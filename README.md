<strong>Importance of Secure Coding</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>60% of breach victims</strong> said they were breached due to an unpatched known vulnerability where the patch was not applied.<br>
<br>
62% were <strong>unware that their organizations were vulnerable</strong> prior to the data breach<br>
<br>
52% of respondents say their organizations are at a <strong>disadvantage in responding to vulnerabilities because they use manual processes</strong><br>
